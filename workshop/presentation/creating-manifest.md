# Creating a Manifest

In this section we'll create a manifest by hand step by step. Even though you can copy and paste the code from here, it is recommended to type these out yourself.

In most cases in production you won't actually be creating manifests by hand. You will probably have different systems and workflows from other institutions so will need to determine the best way for you to create manifests.

#todo:0 refer back to the charts here for required and recommended properties: http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.1/#b-summary-of-metadata-requirements
