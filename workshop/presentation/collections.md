# Collections

Collections group separate IIIF manifests. Institutions have taken a couple of different approaches to creating collections.
<!-- #todo:420 write about collections -->

<!-- #todo:230 comment on permanence of collections? -->

## Approaches

### Newspapers

http://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=http://dams.llgc.org.uk/iiif/newspapers/3100020.json

You can open a <a href="../manifests/collection-newspapers-truncated.json" target="_blank">truncted version of this manifest</a>.

Note the use of the `navDate` which the viewer can use to order the manifests by date.

<!-- #todo:170 add something more about navDate -->
