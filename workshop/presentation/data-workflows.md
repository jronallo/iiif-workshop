# Presentation Data Workflows

TODO

- What identifier(s) do you have that are shared across systems?
- Where do you store descriptive metadata?
- Do you current store technical information like width and hight about images?
- How can you export data from these systems? Do you have adequate APIs into your systems?
- Will you be able to dynamically query for data via APIs or will you need to export data dumps?

<!-- #important:0 Show how different types of data that might be coming from different systems get mapped into IIIF. Talk about how to approach that mapping and automating output of manifests. -->
