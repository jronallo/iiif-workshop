# Manifest Editor

So far we've created our manifest by hand. In most cases you'll want to discover ways to automate the creation of manifests. In some cases though you want to allow for the crafting of manifests. The community is beginning to develop applications for the creation and editing of manifests.

Open the [Bodleian Manifest Editor][bod-manifest-editor].

## Challenges

**How can you import your current manifest?**

**How would you add another canvas?** Try adding plate 2 to the resource and putting it in the correct order. Hint: Image URI should be https://iiif.lib.ncsu.edu/iiif/segPap_005/full/500,/0/default.jpg.

**How would you add some metadata?**

**How would you export your updated manifest from the system?** When you save the manifest, save it in your `iiif-workshop` directory as `bod-manifest.json`. You can now [view the manifest in Universal Viewer](http://universalviewer.io/uv.html?manifest=http://localhost:3000/bod-manifest.json). Open Mirador and add http://localhost:3000/bod-manifest.json.
