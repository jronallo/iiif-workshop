# Mirador

## View Our Example Manifest

To view our example manifest either look at the embedded viewer below or use the Mirador demo.

### Embedded Viewer

Here's an embedded Mirador viewer pointing to our local manifest already.

{% include "../includes/presentation/mirador-iframe.html" %}

<a href="mirador-demo.html" target="_blank">open Mirador in a new window</a>

<!-- #todo:240 actually vendor the mirador viewer code into the workshop materials for offline use -->

<!-- #todo:130 Consider adding either an image with what Mirador ought to look like at this point or include another embed that points to the manifest we've created served up from this gitbook. -->

### Using the Mirador Demo

Mirador home page: http://projectmirador.org/

Open the Mirador site and click on the "try a live demo" button.

You'll see some sample content. Click the "x" to close one of the windows.

Click the upper-lefthand dropdown to "Replace Object".

In the "Add new object from URL:" field enter: http://localhost:3000/manifest.json

Click on the "load" button.

You should see your "Papillons" image show up. Click on it.
