# Viewers

Once you have a Presentation manifest you can use a rich client application to view the resource.

If you don't have your [web server](../preparation/web-server.md) running, get it running now and make sure you can get to your manifest at this address: http://localhost:3000/manifest.json

We'll try our manifest in two viewers:

- [Universal Viewer](universal-viewer.md)
- [Mirador](mirador.md)
