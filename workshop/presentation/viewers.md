# Viewers

Once you have a Presentation manifest you can use a rich client application to view the resource.

If you don't have your [web server](../preparation/web-server.md) running, get it running now and make sure you can get to your manifest at this address: http://localhost:3000/manifest.json

We'll try our manifest in two viewers:

- [Universal Viewer](universal-viewer.md)
- [Mirador](mirador.md)

We can use each of these viewers as we go along further to test out properties and information we add to our manifest to see what features they enable.

<!-- #todo:310 mention Manifesto as a way to create your own new viewer based on UV components http://blog.edsilv.com/manifesto/ -->
