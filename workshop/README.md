# Introduction

This workshop will give you experience with the Image and Presentation APIs and give an introduction to the Content Search and Authentication APIs.

We'll learn about IIIF through live, interactive demonstrations and and hands-on exercises.

We'll dive in to working with IIIF as quickly as possible. We'll keep prefatory material to a minimum. As we go along we'll ask questions and talk about what IIIF is and why to adopt the IIIF standards.
