# Option 1: Virtual Machine

**NOT YET FULLY IMPLEMENTED.** The virtual machine will eventually have everything that's needed.

Requirements for running the virtual machine are [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). You ought to be able to use a package manager to install these or go to the sites for directions on how to install.

Clone the workshop: ...

<!-- #todo:470 give directions for cloning the workshop -->

In a terminal change into the `vm` directory: `cd iiif-workshop/vm`

Start the virtual machine and provision it: `vagrant up`. This takes a long time.

If you got errors try running `vagrant provision`.

<!-- #todo:840 Publish an already fully provisioned VM that just needs to be downloaded and run. -->
