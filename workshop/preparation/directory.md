# Web Server Directory

1. **Create a directory/folder named "iiif-workshop"**

  Doesn't matter where as long as you'll be able to find it.

  On a Mac in the terminal you can type:

  ```sh
  mkdir iiif-workshop
  ```

2. **Change into the "iiif-workshop" directory**

  On a Mac:

  ```sh
  cd iiif-workshop
  ```

3. **Open an empty file in your text editor**

  If you're using Atom you can type:

  ```sh
  atom test.txt
  ```

4. **Add any content to your "test.txt" file**

5. **Start your [local web server](web-server.md)** if you haven't already

6. **Open http://localhost:3000**

  You ought to see the contents of your "iiif-workshop" directory with a file named "text.txt".

  If you used Web Server for Chrome according to the instructions, you can visit http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000. From now on we'll use "localhost" in every case, but if that doesn't work, substitute "127.0.0.1".

7. **Click on "text.txt"**

  You should see the text you added to your file in your browser.

OK! You're all set. We'll use this directory throughout the workshop to edit and deliver files to our browser.
