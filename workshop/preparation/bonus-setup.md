# Bonus Setup

There are some optional, more technical exercises that you can do if you have some extra things installed.

You should have `git` installed.

For additional setup you have two options:

1. [Use a virtual machine](virtual-machine.md) (Vagrant and Virtualbox). Easier.
2. [Install all dependencies locally](local-install.md). More complicated.

> Either method will require large downloads and time, so best to do this before the workshop.
