# Preparation

In order for the workshop to go smoothly


## Requirements

- modern browser
- text editor, preferably one that does syntax highlighting (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/))
- a simple [local web server](web-server.md)

That's it. With just those and a network connection you ought to be able to follow along with the major portions of the workshop.

## Bonus Setup

There are some optional exercises that you can do if you have some extra things installed.

For additional setup you have two options:

1. Use a virtual machine (Vagrant and Virtualbox)
2. Install all dependencies locally

### Option 1: Virtual Machine

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. The virtual machine will eventually have everything that's needed.

### Option 2: Local Install

To explore a static image server:
- Python (2 or 3)
- Clone the _large_ repo here in advance: https://github.com/zimeon/iiif

To explore a dynamic image server:
- Install Java 8 (Oracle JRE or OpenJDK)
- Download: https://github.com/medusa-project/cantaloupe/releases/download/v3.3.2/Cantaloupe-3.3.2.zip
