# Preparation

In order for the workshop to go smoothly, please

If you have ad blockers on you may want to disable them during the workshop. Sometimes they'll get in the way of some JavaScript running.

## Requirements

- Laptop
- [Recent, modern browser](browser.md) (preferably Chrome and Firefox)
- Text editor, preferably one that does syntax highlighting (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/))
- A simple [local web server](web-server.md)

That's it. With just those and a network connection you ought to be able to follow along with the major portions of the workshop.

If you would like to work on some of the more technical aspects of the workshop, please follow the [bonus setup](bonus-setup.md) instructions.
