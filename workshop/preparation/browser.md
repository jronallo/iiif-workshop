# Browser

Any recent version of Chrome or Firefox will work. Since an easy way to launch a [simple web server](web-server.md) involves installing a chrome extension, you may choose to use Chrome.

## Viewing JSON

As we'll be taking a look at JSON in a browser at times to make sure things are working, you may want to install an extension for your browser that will pretty up your JSON. These extensions will also validate the format of the JSON which can be helpful in finding syntax errors.

> Note that the extensions will not validate whether a IIIF document is valid to the IIIF standards--just that the JSON format is correct.
