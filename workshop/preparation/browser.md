# Browser

Any recent version of Chrome or Firefox will work. Since an easy way to launch a [simple web server](web-server.md) involves installing a chrome extension, you may choose to use Chrome.

## Viewing JSON

As we'll be taking a look at JSON in a browser at times to make sure things are working, you may want to install an extension for your browser that will pretty up your JSON. These extensions will also validate the format of the JSON which can be helpful in finding syntax errors.

> Note that the extensions will not validate whether a IIIF document is valid to the IIIF standards--just that the JSON format is correct.

### Developer Tools

With either option you may also need to open the [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools). On Windows and Linux this is `Ctrl + Shift + I`. On Mac use `Ctrl + Opt + I`.

## Clearing the Browser Cache

Sometimes the browser may cache a resource that you're working on that you've changed. To see the new data you'll need to clear your cache. It is possible in Firefox and Chrome to select an option to disable the cache while the developer tools are open.

Alternatively you may want to try the following browser extensions:

Chrome: #todo:0 Find a simple Chrome cache clearing extension

## Multiple Windows

Make sure you know how to place two windows next to each other. As  you work through some exercises it will be helpful to have two windows open side by side.
