# Work in Progress

This workshop is a work in progress.

<!-- #backlog:460 add some kind of notes about how we could use feedback to make this better -->

## todos

If you'd like to see some of the known outstanding todos you can search the text and comments for them.

The workshop materials are written in Markdown and [todo items use the hash style][hash-style].

They are enclosed in HTML comments to hide them from users.

One way to look for these comments is to install the [Atom editor][atom] with the [imdone-atom] package to see a nice task board style interface.
