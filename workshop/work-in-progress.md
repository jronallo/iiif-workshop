# Work in Progress

This workshop is a work in progress.

## todos

If you'd like to see some of the known outstanding todos you can search the text and comments for them.

The workshop materials are written in Markdown so todo items use the hash character followed by a keyword followed by a colon and finally a number that sets the priority of the item. These comments start like these examples:

- `#todo:820 This is a todo with a priority of 3000`
- `#doing:1000 This item is being worked on`

Many are enclosed in HTML comments like this which hide them from current users of the workshop materials:

```html
<!-- #todo:810 this a todo item with a low priority -->
```

One way to look for these comments is to install the [Atom editor][atom] with the [imdone-atom] package to see a nice task board style interface.
