# Work in Progress

This workshop is a work in progress.

<!-- #todo:970 add some kind of notes about how we could use feedback to make this better -->

## todos

If you'd like to see some of the known outstanding todos you can search the text and comments for them.

The workshop materials are written in Markdown so todo items use the hash character followed by a keyword followed by a colon and finally a number that sets the priority of the item. These comments start like these examples:

- `#todo:810 This is a todo with a priority of 30`
- `#doing:10 This item is being worked on`

Many are enclosed in HTML comments like this which hide them from current users of the workshop materials:

```html
<!-- #todo:9920 this a todo item with a low priority -->
```

One way to look for these comments is to install the Atom editor with the imdone-atom package to see a nice task board style interface.

<!-- #todo:260 add links for atom and imdone-atom  -->
