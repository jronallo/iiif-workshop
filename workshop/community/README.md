<!-- #backlog:700 write community section -->

IIIF is pushed forward by technical specification and community groups. Technical specification groups are responsible for developing new IIIF specifications. Community groups are less formal and can bring together practitioners in a certain domain.

> Where can you find documents for community groups?

On the community calls you can share updates and demos with the community.

<!-- #backlog:0 add a section here on promoting IIIF. Maybe an exercise where folks work on their elevator pitches? -->
