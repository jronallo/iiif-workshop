# QuickStart

If you want a quick implementation overview, see the current [IIIF quick start guide](http://iiif.io/technical-details/). This workshop will go in-depth on each of the points there.

You may also want to check out the _draft_ "[For Implementers]" guide which orients implementers to the different considerations that need to be made and gives recommendations on how to get started.

<!-- #todo:30 remove _draft_ once published to the website -->
