# Core APIs

The [Image](image/README.md) and [Presentation](presentation/README.md) APIs are the core IIIF APIs. Start there for an understanding of what IIIF enables.

Throughout you'll see different examples of how these two specifications interrelate and we'll dive deeper into that relationship. Suffice it to say for now that these two work together to support these different patterns of use:

- Single huge image with pan/zoom
- Single image in different viewers for customized viewing and work space experiences
- Multiple images in a single viewer for image comparison
- Multiple images from different institutions to form a single resource

Here's a simple visual representation of a user interface to give an example of how these two core APIs work together:

<!-- #todo:0 write more about the the core APIs -->

<!-- #todo:0 is this a space to mention that you don't have to do all of everything in this workshop? you can start simple and level up over time. iterative development. -->

<!-- #todo:0 What to call the sections that aren't the core APIs -->
