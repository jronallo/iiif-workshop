## 3D

While 3D in IIIF has not been specified there is interst in the community and as of this writing a call has gone out for forming a community group.

Universal Viewer has some support for displaying 3D objects. You can see some examples including a [skull] and [the Kiss].

[skull]: http://universalviewer.io/examples/#?manifest=https%3A%2F%2Fedsilv.github.io%2Ftest-manifests%2Fpres3-3d.json
[the Kiss]: http://universalviewer.io/examples/#?manifest=http%3A%2F%2Ffiles.universalviewer.io%2Fmanifests%2Ffoundobjects%2Fthekiss.json
