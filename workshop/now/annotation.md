# Annotation

<!-- #todo:0 write annotation section -->

We've seen various annotations throughout the workshop already. Images are applied to canvases via annotation. Content search results are expressed as annotations.

#todo:0 are there other instance in the workshop where we've already mentioned annotations?

Here we're going to look at annotations more in depth and talk about other uses of annotations.

Readers make marks in books. You bookmark pages in your browser. You quote a passage of text and comment on it. IIIF provides the platform for allowing for all different kinds of scholarly annotation.

<!-- #todo:0 maybe mention hypothesis? -->

While annotation is specified outside of IIIF it is useful to have a basic understanding of how annotations work.

<!-- #todo:0 add image of annotations here -->

## Creation Annotations
