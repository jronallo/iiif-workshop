# Use Cases

The IIIF specifications are developed in a process that requires gathering, clarifying, and distilling use cases.

Throughout the workshop, let's keep in mind why we're looking at IIIF. Here are some questions we can keep in mind as we go along.

- Who are the users for your image resources?
- What different kinds of users do you have?
- How do they want to be able to use your image resources?
- What kinds of users and uses would you like to serve better?
- How might IIIF enable that?

## Exercise

Let's hear some of the use cases you have so that we can return to them later.

How would you fill in the blanks?

  As a [user], I want to [blank], so that I can [blank].

Here's an example:

As an _art student_, I want to _zoom in on an image_, so that I can _learn about the brush strokes of a particular artist_.

> Take a quick look at the images in this [blog post][wendymac] for an example of a surprising discovery. (As well as a good argument for why an art student still wants to see the painting in person.)

## Initial Questions

Do you have questions about how IIIF can help support your users?

Feel free to ask questions about how something might help support particular use cases you have.
