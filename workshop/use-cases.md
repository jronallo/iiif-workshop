# Use Cases

Throughout the workshop, let's keep in mind why we're doing this. Here are some questions we can keep in mind as we go along.

- Who are the users for your image resources?
- What different kinds of users do you have?
- How do they want to be able to use your image resources?
- What kinds of users and uses would you like to serve better?
- How might IIIF enable that?

## Exercise

Let's hear some of the use cases you have so that we can return to them later.

How would you fill in the blanks?

  As a [user], I want to [blank], so that I can [blank].

Here's an example:

As an _art student_, I want to _zoom in on an image_, so that I can _learn about the brush strokes of a particular artist_.

<!-- #todo:0 What's a better use case example? -->

## Initial Questions

Do you have questions about how IIIF can help support your users?

Feel free to ask questions about how something might help support particular use cases you have.
