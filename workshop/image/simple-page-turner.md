# Simple Page Turner

While we'll cover more full-featured viewers when we get to the Presentation API, it is possible though to create a rudimentary page turner with image viewers like Leaflet and OpenSeadragon.

You can see a [simple example of OpenSeadragon as a page turner](https://openseadragon.github.io/examples/tilesource-iiif/).

<!-- #todo:720 write simple page turner or point out to another example other than OSD -->
