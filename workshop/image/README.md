# Image API

The Image API helped get pixels to a client like a browser.

In this section you'll learn about [version 2.1.1 of the Image API](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.1/). You'll learn about:

- Why there's a need for an image API
- Why you might want to serve your images via IIIF
- The parameters of a IIIF image URL
- How the `info.json` encodes information about an image

You'll gain hands-on experience working with the Image API.

<!-- #todo:700 What other learning objectives? -->

The purpose of the Image API is to have a way to request the needed bits of an image.

## What the Image API is Not
- Image API does not give structure for viewing a series of images.
- Does not allow for showing descriptive metadata with the image.
- Does not provide every possible image manipulation you might want. It is not Photoshop.
