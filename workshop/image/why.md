# Why IIIF Images?

IIIF standards for images solve a number of challenges with images on the web:

- Having users download an entire large image file is **inefficient** and will likely provide a **poor user experience**.
- Before IIIF there were **too many standards** for delivering images and institutions solved the same challenges over and over again. Too much **duplication of effort** for the basics of image delivery.
- The standard has allowed for **shared software** for delivering images and image tiles for deep zoom viewers. Once these basic needs are met it is also easier to then utilize more advanced shared software.
- Institutions want to share images, but not necessarily give them away. IIIF allows for **retaining control** and tracking reuse outside of your own site.
- Creating and recreating access images and copying the files around for different platforms is a pain.

## Solutions

- Consistent way to access image derivatives
- Publish once, reuse often
- Standard URL structure for accessing images
- Standard package for information about an image
- Supports rights
- Supports tiling

> IIIF doesn't just keep you out of silos; it keeps you out of dead ends. -- Richard Higgins, Durham Uniersity

Even if you are already delivering deep zoom images, by adopting the IIIF Image API you will gain the ability to use a new range of viewers and tools. Your users will too.
