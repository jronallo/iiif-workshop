# Why IIIF Images?

IIIF standards for images solve a number of challenges with images on the web:

- Having users download an entire large file is **inefficient** and will likely provide a **poor user experience**.
- Before IIIF there were **too many standards** for delivering images and institutions solved the same challenges over and over again. Too much **duplication of effort** for the basics of image delivery.
- The standard has allowed for **shared software** for delivering images and image tiles for deep zoom viewers.
- Share images, but not necessarily give them away. IIIF allows for **retaining control** and tracking reuse outside of your own site.

## Solutions

- Consistent way to access image derivatives
- Standard URL structure for accessing images
- Standard package for information about an image
- Supports rights
- Supports tiling
