# Image Comparison

## Leaflet

You can use Leaflet to compare two images:
- [side-by-side](http://resources.digirati.com/iiif/an-introduction-to-iiif/dee-sbs.html)
- [magnifying glass](http://resources.digirati.com/iiif/an-introduction-to-iiif/dee-mag.html)

## Compariscope

### Compariscope Example: X-Raying Balenciaga

TTake a look at these [x-rays of Balenciaga garments][x-rays]. Be sure to click on "enable x-ray" and then mouse over the image.

### Compariscope Example: Hadleigh Castle

Hadleigh Castle by John Constable, 1776â€“1837, British

Below are links to a sketch and then a finished painting. By comparing these two paintings we can see how the painter changed the scene.

You can try these images in the [Compariscope].

Here's a video of creating this kind of comparison:

## Idea: Painting and Place

If you tour Arles, France, you can take the Van Gogh walk where reproductions of paintings are placed from the perspective of where they were painted. With IIIF it would be possible to do similar with tools like those above.

## Mirador

We'll see more later about how [Mirador](../presentation/mirador.md) can be used for image comparison even with images across institutions.

Take a look at how the [Boxwood Project](http://boxwood.ago.ca/) from the Art Gallery of Ontario uses Mirador to compare objects.
