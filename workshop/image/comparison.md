## Compariscope

Example: Hadleigh Castle by John Constable, 1776–1837, British

Below are links to a sketch and then a finished painting. By comparing these two paintings we can see how the painter changed the scene.

Here's a video of what this kind of comparison looks like:

## Idea: Painting and Place

If you tour Arles, France, you can take the Van Gogh walk where reproductions of paintings are placed from the perspective of where they were painted. With IIIF it would be possible to do similar with tools like those above.

## Mirador

We'll see more later about how [Mirador](../presentation/mirador.md) can be used for image comparison even with images across institutions.
